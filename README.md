Hello, this repository was made in order to create mini-games in java, to train my logic.

I don't work as a programmer, and java is a language that I at least know the syntax of. To get better at java programming, I'll try to make simple games and, as needed, create more complex ones over time.

I like feedback, so if anyone sees this, I'd like to know what you think and what I should improve on.
